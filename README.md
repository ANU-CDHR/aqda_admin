    <br>
</p>

The AQDA is an online digital archive about LGBTIQA+ forced displacement. It is part of the PhD research. The AQDA Administration System is a data management system that records metadata about interviews. It also provides a REST API that can be used to provide data to a public-facing system and allows it to display data in various ways, such as the AQDA Public System. 

The system was built with the Yii framework (http://www.yiiframework.com/) and Yii Advanced Project Template (https://www.yiiframework.com/extension/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced). 

The installation involves running 'composer install' (https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/en/structure-extensions).

For customisation or configuration, please refer to the Yii guide (https://www.yiiframework.com/doc/guide/2.0/) and Yii Advanced Template guide (https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced).
